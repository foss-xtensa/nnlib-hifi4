     * Creates a prepared model for execution.

     * or compilation into the device's native binary format. The model itself
     * is not changed.
     *

     * prepareModel function must verify the inputs to the prepareModel function
     * are correct. If there is an error, prepareModel must immediately invoke
     * the callback with the appropriate ErrorStatus value and nullptr for the
     * IPreparedModel, then return with the same ErrorStatus. If the inputs to
     * the prepareModel function are valid and there is no error, prepareModel
     * must launch an asynchronous task to prepare the model in the background,
     * and immediately return from prepareModel with ErrorStatus::NONE. If the
     * asynchronous task fails to launch, prepareModel must immediately invoke
     * the callback with ErrorStatus::GENERAL_FAILURE and nullptr for the
     * IPreparedModel, then return with ErrorStatus::GENERAL_FAILURE.
     *
     * When the asynchronous task has finished preparing the model, it must
     * immediately invoke the callback function provided as an input to

     * value and nullptr for the IPreparedModel.

     * the shape of the tensors, which may only be known at execution time. As
     * such, some driver services may return partially prepared models, where
     * the prepared model can only be finished when it is paired with a set of
     * inputs to the model. Note that the same prepared model object can be
     * used with different shapes of inputs on different (possibly concurrent)
