// Class for setting reasonable OpenMP threading settings. (OpenMP is used by
// the Eigen matrix library.)
//
// Currently sets a low blocktime: the time OpenMP threads busy-wait for more
// work before going to sleep. See b/79159165, https://reviews.llvm.org/D18577.
// The default is 200ms, we set to 20ms here, see b/109645291. This keeps the
// cores enabled throughout inference computation without too much extra power
// consumption afterwards.
//
// The OpenMP settings are thread-local (applying only to worker threads formed
// from that thread), see https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/522688 and
// http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/openmp-dev/2016-July/001432.html. This class
// ensures that within the scope in which an object is instantiated we use the
// right settings (scopes may be nested), as long as no other library changes
// them.  (Note that in current NNAPI usage only one instance is used in the
// CpuExecutor thread).
//
// TODO(mikie): consider also setting the number of threads used. Using as many
// threads as there are cores results in more variable performance: if we don't
// get all cores for our threads, the latency is doubled as we wait for one core
// to do twice the amount of work. Reality is complicated though as not all
// cores are the same. Decision to be based on benchmarking against a
// representative set of workloads and devices. I'm keeping the code here for
// reference.
