======================================================================
Revision History
======================================================================

Version 2.4.0 API 1.0: Feb 10, 2021

+ Intermediate Release of HiFi 4 NN Library
+ Tested using RI.5 tools, xt-xcc/xt-xc++ and xt-clang/xt-clang++ compiler
+ Added support for asymmetric quantized 8 bit (int8) variants of 
  following TFLM operators
    Quantize
    SVDF
+ Updated TFLM example testbench to newer version of TFLM framework
+ Improved optimization for reminder loop in xa_nn_vec_softmax_asym8s_16 
+ Reduced memory banking conflicts in FC kernel xa_nn_fully_connected_sym8sxasym8s_asym8s

Limitations
> The ANN test bench, TFLite Micro example application and the supporting libraries
  need support for C++11 standard. This is supported only with Xtensa C library. 
> For configurations without VFPU, the floating point  variants of the kernels 
  are not supported and should not be used. 

Known issues
> Compiler optimizations are disabled for C++ source files 
> 3 failures seen in ANN testcases because  of differences in reference 
  code implementations:
    DEPTHWISE_CONV2D_FLOAT_LARGE_2_WEIGHTS_AS_INPUTS
    LOCAL_RESPONSE_NORM_FLOAT_4
    LOCAL_RESPONSE_NORM_FLOAT_4_RELAXED
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.0 API 1.0: Dec 22, 2020

+ Intermediate Release of HiFi 4 NN Library
+ Tested using RI.5 tools, xt-xcc/xt-xc++ and xt-clang/xt-clang++ compiler
+ Added support for asymmetric quantized 8 bit (int8) variants of 
  following TFLM operators
    Conv2D (Standard convolution)
    Depthwise convolution
    Fully connected
    Softmax
    Average Pool (using existing 8x8 variant)
    Max Pool (using existing 8x8 variant)
+ Enabled cross compilation for HiFi 3. 
+ Removed kernel padding requirement for depthwise convolution kernels.
+ [TENA-2712] Convolution 1D: Fix incorrect zero bias values in the call 
  to function xa_nn_matXvec_asym8xasym8_asym8_circ_nb.
